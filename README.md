# AsbjÃ¸rn Ulsberg

Hi, I'm AsbjÃ¸rn Ulsberg and I've been programming professionally for 20 years
and as a hobby for more than 30. I have a passion for software architecture and
spend a lot of time thinking about modeling and naming things. The web has
always been close to my heart, so I spend time in IETF and W3C working groups to
make it better.

When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughter as well as
participating in the [demoscene] and making music with my alter ego [Bitbear]. I
love creativity and continuous improvement, which are two of the driving forces
that get me out of the bed every morning.

## ðŸŒ± Skills

I've been working as a backend developer, frontend developer, CTO and architect,
in all sorts of programming languages, ranging from Visual Basic to C, Perl,
Ruby, Python, PHP, C#, JavaScript, Bash, etc. I therefore consider myself
polyglot and "full-stack", whatever that means. I enjoy all parts of
development, appreciate most programming languages and find the freedom to use
the right tool for the job a liberating, creative and rewarding experience.
